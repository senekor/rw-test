# Rust Exercises

This repository contains the exercises that go along with my [Rust workshop][workshop-repo].

Below, you'll find additional learning resources that you may want to keep in reach while learning Rust.
The list is intentionally kept short and opinionated.

Get started with [day_1/README.md](day_1/README.md).

## Learning resources

- [The Book][the-book], for learning methodically
- [Rust By Example][rust-by-example], for looking things up

## Practice resources

- language & syntax basics: [rustlings]
- Rust-specific exercises with provided test: [Exercism][exercism]
- general programming exercises (text-in, text-out): [Advent of Code][advent-of-code]

## Ecosystem Wegweiser

- community-driven shortlist of high-quality libraries: [blessed.rs][blessed-rs]
- library documentation: [docs.rs][docs-rs]
  - handy shortcut: `docs.rs/<library-name>`
  - example for the `winnow` crate: [docs.rs/winnow][docs-winnow]
- community-driven newsletter: [This Week in Rust][this-week-in-rust]
